# Heat Pump Efficiency Dashboard

This project presents a reactive web application developed using Shiny for Python, designed to provide an interactive dashboard that visualizes the effectiveness of heat pumps across various locations in the United States. The dashboard leverages real-time weather data from the Weather MateO API to evaluate and display the performance of heat pumps under different weather conditions for a specific year.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can explore the performance of heat pumps in different US locations, with real-time updates and responsive visualizations.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Integration with the Weather MateO API ensures up-to-date weather conditions are used in the analysis.
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Detailed insights on how heat pumps perform in diverse climates and regions across the US.
- **Year-Specific Data**: Users can select a specific year to see how heat pumps have fared historically under varying weather patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Shiny for Python**: Enables the creation of the reactive web application with dynamic UI components.
- **Weather MateO API**: Provides real-time weather data for accurate analysis.
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and integration.
- **Plotly**: Used for creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs.
